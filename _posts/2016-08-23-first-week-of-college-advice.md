Yay! Thankfully, I got through the first week as a freshman at The University of Texas at Austin. The transition between a school of four thousand students to a school of fifty-five thousand students was insane, but my first week at UT has taught me a lot. As I go through the years, I'm sure I will learn much more than what I am about to say right now, but I feel like this is an important moment to share. Without further ado, here are my top five pieces of advice for college freshmen.

## Explore campus

When asked about what kind of university I wanted to go to, I was completely unsure. Small sized, medium sized, large sized? I assumed that all facilities would be within my reach, for instance, dinner would literally be ten feet away. Fortunately or unfortunately, UT turned out to be extra-large sized. I still remember the first time I came here in April; there were so many buildings everywhere and the name "40 acres" really rung true for me.

UT on a map looks pretty small in comparison to the surrounding areas. Navigating the campus seems doable until you're placed in the middle of the quad to wander aimlessly. Don't be like me – I assumed that I knew where all my classes were by pointing to their location on my iPhone screen. I encourage all college freshmen to explore the campus – especially where your classes are.

Other than your classes, there are so many other things university campuses have to offer. From dining halls to libraries to social areas, college is nothing like high school. There is so much to do; all you need to do is find it.

## Meet new people

Being a recluse in college is extremely tempting. In fact, I'm still practicing some bad habits by eating lunch alone or studying by myself. While it is important to strike a balance between being too outgoing and being too reserved, meeting other people is important. For one, you get to meet people that you might have never met in your community, which is a great experience. Coming from the Silicon Valley, latinos, caucasians, and African-Americans are little in number. At UT, there is a plethora of all races, which is fantastic! I want to have a diverse group of friends instead of completely being absorbed by people in my ethnic group.

Other than the social aspect of friendship, knowing other people can be rewarding. If you get to know someone in one of your classes, you have just formed a mini study group. What's great is that you will probably meet the friends of your friend as well, so in turn you will have more friends. If you keep doing this, you'll be friends with the whole school! Just kidding, but seriously – branch out and meet people.

Coming from California, it has been difficult for me to "click" with people. Many freshmen are from Texas (not surprisingly) and are sticking with the friend groups that they made back in high school. Getting into those cliques is difficult, but not impossible. Try to introduce yourself to many people; I guarantee you will not be fond of some, but eventually, things will fall in place.

## Show up to class

Coming from high school, this was a shocker when I first heard it. I always thought to myself, "Why would I not show up to class?" But, after a week of college, it became pretty obvious why one would not show up to class.

College life is different because first, your parents are not looming over your head dictating your every move, and second, the schedule that you have is spread out. You could theoretically have class at 9pm, if you wanted to. With the amount of activities going on, it is easy to skip class, because there is usually no penalty for doing so.

Many classes have an additional section called "recitation" or "discussion." This is where the TAs go over important concepts taught in class and ensure that the students are keeping up with the material. For the classes that sometimes have mandatory attendance for lectures, the discussion sections are pretty much optional to attend.

Take a look at any research study that found the relationship between academic performance and academic attendance. The correlation is, more often than not, strong and positive. Basically, if you show up to class, pay attention, and do the homework, you're going to do well. So far, I have overcome the urges not to go to my discussion sections, and I very much hope I continue to do so!

## Be humble

This was something I never knew I would confront, but I did. When I took AP Computer Science my senior year, it was without a doubt that I was one of the top students in the class. Programming pretty much came to me and I hardly had to study for the tests and quizzes in order to do well. Unfortunately, I developed a "superiority complex" where I felt like I always knew the answer to CS-related questions, even when helping out my peers.

The first meeting with my POD, which is basically a tightly knit group for computer science students, was interesting. We went around the room discussing our previous experience with computer science. The students in my POD had developed iOS/Android apps, worked with languages like C#, and had done competitive programming. I was intimidated, to say the least. I had never been thrown into a pond with big fish, but I had been accustomed to be the big fish.

Unfortunately, I have not found out what the secret is to dealing with this. Many people have said to collaborate with others – this ensures a give-and-take situation where you contribute something to the discussion and get information from your peers. In the process, both of you grow. So far, I have had this exchange with two computer science students, and I have learned a lot, actually. Just keep your chin up high (but not too high!).

## Have fun

Ultimately, college can be stressful. There is a lot going on and a lot of activities to balance between. Both the social scene and academic life can be stressful. In the beginning, it seems like it is impossible, but after a week or so, you will get into a routine, which will make college seem much less daunting.

For those of you that are starting college – good luck!
